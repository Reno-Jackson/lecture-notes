            Give me tacos, or give me death. 50 cent tacos! I’ll take 30. Yeah, apparently the taco shack was robbed. They left the money but took the tacos. It’s a wonderful morning for breakfast tacos. It’s a wonderful morning for breakfast tacos. Does guac cost extra? Say taco one more time. Tacos dorados called flautas, or taquitos, for which the tortillas are filled with pre-cooked shredded chicken, beef or barbacoa, rolled into an elongated cylinder and deep-fried until crisp.
            Does guac cost extra? If you were a taco, would you eat yourself? Um, Tabasco? No thanks, do you have any Cholula? Shrimp tacos are tasty tacos! TACOS!! Black or pinto beans? Does guac cost extra? Side of rice and beans, please. It’s raining tacos, from out of the sky, tacos, don’t even ask why. I think I’ve overdosed on tacos. Say taco one more time. It’s long been rumored that the chupacabra is really just a crazed man who’s local taco shop went out of business. Side of rice and beans, please.
